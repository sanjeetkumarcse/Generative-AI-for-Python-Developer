Instead of sending all the data to a faraway central server (like the cloud) for processing, **Edge Computing** processes the data right near the device itself—on the \"edge\" of the network. This means faster responses and less reliance on distant servers. For example, the camera can analyze video footage locally to detect motion and only send important alerts to the cloud.\n",

It’s like a network of smaller, local servers or devices that help process and store data closer to where it’s generated, but not directly on the device itself. Fog Computing helps when the edge devices need extra computing power or when multiple devices need to share data locally before sending it to the cloud. For instance, in a smart city, traffic sensors might send data to nearby fog nodes to analyze traffic patterns before sending summarized data to the cloud.\n",

Here\\'s the code:\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\n\\ndef linear_regression(X, y):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Perform Linear Regression to find the coefficients (slope and intercept).\\n    \\n    Parameters:\\n        X (array-like): Independent variable (features).\\n        y (array-like): Dependent variable (target).\\n    \\n    Returns:\\n        tuple: (slope, intercept) of the linear regression line.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    # Ensure X and y are numpy arrays\\n    X = np.array(X)\\n    y = np.array(y)\\n    \\n    # Calculate the mean of X and y\\n    X_mean = np.mean(X)\\n    y_mean = np.mean(y)\\n    \\n    # Calculate the slope (m)\\n    numerator = np.sum((X - X_mean) * (y - y_mean))\\n    denominator = np.sum((X - X_mean) ** 2)\\n    slope = numerator / denominator\\n    \\n    # Calculate the intercept (b)\\n    intercept = y_mean - slope * X_mean\\n    \\n    return slope, intercept\\n\\n# Example usage:\\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\\n    # Example data\\n    X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\\n    y = [2, 4, 5, 4, 5]\\n    \\n    slope, intercept = linear_regression(X, y)\\n    print(f\"Slope: {slope}, Intercept: {intercept}\")\\n```\\n\\n### Key Concepts Explained:\\n1. **Inputs**:\\n   - `X`: Represents the independent variable (e.g., features, predictor variable).\\n   - `y`: Represents the dependent variable (e.g., target, response variable).\\n\\n2. **Steps**:\\n   - First, calculate the mean of `X` and `y`.\\n   - Then, compute the slope (`m`) using the formula:\\n     \\\\[\\n     m = \\\\frac{\\\\sum{(X_i - \\\\text{mean}(X))(y_i - \\\\text{mean}(y))}}{\\\\sum{(X_i - \\\\text{mean}(X))^2}}\\n     \\\\]\\n   - Finally, calculate the intercept (`b`) using the formula:\\n     \\\\[\\n     b = \\\\text{mean}(y) - m \\\\cdot \\\\text{mean}(X)\\n     \\\\]\\n\\n3. **Output**:\\n   - The function returns the slope and intercept of the best-fit line.\\n\\n### Example:\\nSuppose `X = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `y = [2, 4, 5, 4, 5]`. \\n\\nRunning the above code will output:\\n```\\nSlope: 0.6, Intercept: 2.6\\n```\\n\\n### Notes:\\n- This function is designed for simple linear regression (one independent and one dependent variable). If you\\'re interested in more advanced regression models, or multivariate linear regression, libraries like `scikit-learn` can be very helpful. Let me know if you\\'d like to see an example using `scikit-learn`.'}\n"

First, he emphasizes trusting your intuition and connecting the dots in hindsight, recounting how dropping out of college led him to discover calligraphy, which later influenced the design of the Macintosh. Second, he shares his experience of love and loss, detailing how getting fired from Apple led to renewed creativity, founding NeXT and Pixar, and rediscovering his passion. Lastly, he reflects on facing his own mortality during a cancer diagnosis, urging graduates to follow their hearts, stay true to themselves, and embrace life’s impermanence. He closes with the inspirational mantra, \"Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish.\"\n"

            "The paper *\"Attention Is All You Need\"* introduces the Transformer, a groundbreaking neural network architecture built entirely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrence and convolution. It demonstrates superior performance in sequence transduction tasks, such as machine translation, achieving state-of-the-art BLEU scores on English-to-German (28.4) and English-to-French (41.8) translation tasks, with significantly reduced training time and improved parallelization. Critically, the Transformer outperforms prior single-model architectures and even ensembles in translation quality while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. For instance, the base Transformer model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles on English-to-German translation, achieving BLEU scores of 27.3 and 38.1 for English-to-German and English-to-French tasks, respectively, with training costs of \\( 3.3 \\cdot 10^{18} \\) FLOPs — far lower than competing architectures such as GNMT + RL Ensemble or ConvS2S Ensemble. The larger Transformer (big) model further improves these results, attaining BLEU scores of 28.4 and 41.8 for the same tasks, in just 3.5 days on eight NVIDIA P100 GPUs, less than one-fourth the training cost of the prior state-of-the-art models.\n",

When trained in a semi-supervised configuration with an expanded corpus of 17M sentences and a larger vocabulary size of 32K tokens, the performance further improved, yielding better F1 scores than all previously reported models aside from the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the ﬁrst transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,...,x n) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1,...,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1,...,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n2'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016) kpathsea version 6.2.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'attention_is_all_you_need.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 2, 'page_label': '3'}, page_content='Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The ﬁrst is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices Kand V. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the ﬁnal values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\n5'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016) kpathsea version 6.2.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'attention_is_all_you_need.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention O(n2 ·d) O(1) O(1)\\nRecurrent O(n·d2) O(n) O(n)\\nConvolutional O(k·n·d2) O(1) O(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r·n·d) O(1) O(n/r)\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and ﬁxed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto 10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1,...,x n) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), with xi,zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\n6'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016) kpathsea version 6.2.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'attention_is_all_you_need.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7'}, page_content='the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+ n·d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate= d−0.5\\nmodel ·min(step_num−0.5,step_num·warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_stepstraining steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number.

The conﬁguration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α= 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of ﬂoating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision ﬂoating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\ndevelopment set, newstest2013. We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016) kpathsea version 6.2.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'attention_is_all_you_need.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 8, 'page_label': '9'}, page_content='Table 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-conﬁdence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37].

During inference, we\\nincreased the maximum output length to input length + 300. We used a beam size of 21 and α= 0.3\\nfor both WSJ only and the semi-supervised setting.\\nOur results in Table 4 show that despite the lack of task-speciﬁc tuning our model performs sur-\\nprisingly well, yielding better results than all previously reported models with the exception of the\\nRecurrent Neural Network Grammar [8].\\nIn contrast to RNN sequence-to-sequence models [37], the Transformer outperforms the Berkeley-\\nParser [29] even when training only on the WSJ training set of 40K sentences.\\n7 Conclusion\\nIn this work, we presented the Transformer, the ﬁrst sequence transduction model based entirely on\\nattention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with\\nmulti-headed self-attention.\\nFor translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained signiﬁcantly faster than architectures based\\non recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Therefore, the original summary remains unchanged:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Refined Summary:\\n\\nThe paper *\"Attention Is All You Need\"* introduces the Transformer, a groundbreaking neural network architecture built entirely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrence and convolution. It demonstrates superior performance in sequence transduction tasks, such as machine translation, achieving state-of-the-art BLEU scores on English-to-German (28.4) and English-to-French (41.8) translation tasks, with significantly reduced training time and improved parallelization. Critically, the Transformer outperforms prior single-model architectures and even ensembles in translation quality while requiring substantially fewer computational resources. For instance, the base Transformer model surpasses all previously published models and ensembles on English-to-German translation, achieving BLEU scores of 27.3 and 38.1 for English-to-German and English-to-French tasks, respectively, with training costs of \\\\( 3.3 \\\\cdot 10^{18} \\\\) FLOPs — far lower than competing architectures such as GNMT + RL Ensemble or ConvS2S Ensemble. The larger Transformer (big) model further improves these results, attaining BLEU scores of 28.4 and 41.8 for the same tasks, in just 3.5 days on eight NVIDIA P100 GPUs, less than one-fourth the training cost of the prior state-of-the-art models.\\n\\nThe model generalizes well across tasks, including English constituency parsing, showcasing its robustness and efficiency. In fact, a four-layer Transformer with \\\\( d_{model} = 1024 \\\\), trained on the 40K-sentence WSJ portion of the Penn Treebank, outperformed previous models such as the BerkeleyParser, even in small-data settings. When trained in a semi-supervised configuration with an expanded corpus of 17M sentences and a larger vocabulary size of 32K tokens, the performance further improved, yielding better F1 scores than all previously reported models aside from the Recurrent Neural Network Grammar. Without task-specific tuning, the model delivered strong results, highlighting the versatility of the Transformer architecture.\\n\\nThe Transformer leverages self-attention mechanisms to compute representations of input and output sequences without relying on sequence-aligned recurrence or convolution, enabling constant-time operations for modeling dependencies across arbitrary positions in a sequence. Its encoder-decoder structure consists of stacks of six identical layers, with the encoder employing multi-head self-attention and position-wise feed-forward networks, and the decoder incorporating an additional sub-layer for multi-head attention over the encoder\\'s output. Both components use residual connections with layer normalization to stabilize training. Additionally, the decoder applies masking in its self-attention mechanism to ensure autoregressive behavior, allowing predictions at each position to depend only on previous positions.\\n\\nTo enhance its attention mechanism, the Transformer introduces **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**, which computes weights for values using queries and keys and includes a scaling factor of \\\\( 1/\\\\sqrt{d_k} \\\\) to improve gradient behavior for large \\\\( d_k \\\\). This approach is faster and more space-efficient than additive attention, particularly for optimized matrix multiplication. Furthermore, the Transformer employs **Multi-Head Attention**, where multiple attention heads independently project queries, keys, and values into lower-dimensional spaces, compute attention in parallel, and combine the outputs to capture diverse features from different subspaces. With eight parallel attention heads (\\\\( h=8 \\\\)), each head operates at reduced dimensionality (\\\\( d_k = d_v = d_{model}/h = 64 \\\\)), ensuring computational efficiency while maintaining expressiveness. Multi-head attention is applied in three key ways: (1) **encoder-decoder attention**, where the decoder attends to the encoder’s output to capture input sequence information; (2) **encoder self-attention**, where positions in the encoder attend to other positions within the encoder for contextual understanding; and (3) **decoder self-attention**, where positions in the decoder attend to previous positions to preserve the autoregressive property, enforced by masking to prevent future information flow.\\n\\nEach layer of the encoder and decoder also includes **Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks**, which consist of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between, applied independently to each position. These networks have an input/output dimensionality of \\\\( d_{model} = 512 \\\\) with an inner-layer dimensionality of \\\\( d_{ff} = 2048 \\\\). Furthermore, the Transformer utilizes **embedding layers** for input and output tokens, shared across both embedding and pre-softmax layers, scaled by \\\\( \\\\sqrt{d_{model} } \\\\), to convert tokens to vector representations efficiently.\\n\\nBecause the model lacks recurrence or convolution, **Positional Encoding** is employed to incorporate information about sequence order, ensuring the model can account for relative and absolute positional relationships in the input data. Positional encodings are added to the input embeddings and have the same dimensionality (\\\\( d_{model} \\\\)), allowing the two to be summed. The paper employs sinusoidal positional encodings, defined using sine and cosine functions at varying frequencies, enabling the model to attend by relative positions and potentially extrapolate to sequences longer than those encountered during training—a feature learned positional embeddings do not offer. Experiments replacing sinusoidal positional encodings with learned embeddings showed nearly identical results, highlighting the robustness of the Transformer’s architecture. The encoding function uses geometric progressions of wavelengths, ensuring efficient positional differentiation.\\n\\nSelf-attention is central to the Transformer’s success, as it addresses key challenges in sequence transduction tasks. Compared to recurrent and convolutional layers, self-attention provides superior computational efficiency (\\\\( O(n^2 \\\\cdot d) \\\\)), parallelization (requiring only \\\\( O(1) \\\\) sequential operations per layer), and shorter path lengths for learning long-range dependencies, ensuring direct connections between any two input-output positions. These properties make self-attention particularly advantageous for sentence representations, such as word-piece or byte-pair encodings, which allow the Transformer to process datasets with large vocabularies. Furthermore, experiments suggest that restricting self-attention to a neighborhood size \\\\( r \\\\) could optimize computational performance for very long sequences, though this remains future work. Self-attention also has the benefit of producing more interpretable models, with individual attention heads learning distinct tasks and exhibiting behavior related to the syntactic and semantic structure of sentences. Notably, experiments suggest a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot-product attention could further improve model quality.\\n\\nThe training regime for the Transformer optimizes efficiency and accuracy through strategies such as byte-pair encoding for tokenization and batching sentences by approximate sequence length to ensure a manageable input size for each batch (approximately 25,000 tokens). The model utilizes label smoothing (\\\\( \\\\epsilon_{ls} = 0.1 \\\\)) to improve accuracy and BLEU scores despite slightly increasing perplexity, as well as the Adam optimizer with custom hyperparameters and a learning rate schedule that increases linearly during initial warmup steps (for 4,000 steps) and then decreases proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. Regularization techniques, including residual dropout (\\\\( P_{drop} = 0.1 \\\\)), are applied to sub-layer outputs and positional embeddings to reduce overfitting. Training is highly efficient, with the base model trained in 12 hours on eight NVIDIA P100 GPUs and the larger model trained in approximately 3.5 days. Despite minimal task-specific tuning, experiments on parsing tasks employed dropout adjustments and specific hyperparameter settings, yielding improved performance.\\n\\nThe Transformer’s attention-based innovations, combined with its highly parallelizable design, constant-time dependency modeling, reduced training costs, interpretable behavior, and ability to handle long-range dependencies, make it a revolutionary architecture. Beyond translation, the model shows promise in English constituency parsing tasks and extends well to semi-supervised setups, where it achieves F1 scores comparable to or exceeding prior state-of-the-art parsers. Looking ahead, the authors aim to explore attention-based models in new modalities, including images, audio, and video, as well as optimize restricted self-attention mechanisms for handling large inputs and outputs efficiently. \\n\\nThe Transformer has fundamentally transformed machine learning and natural language processing, achieving unparalleled performance in key tasks, while providing an open-source framework for future innovation.'}\n"
