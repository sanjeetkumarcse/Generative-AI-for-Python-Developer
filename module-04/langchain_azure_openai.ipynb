The provided code is clear and concise, offering a great explanation of the steps involved. Below, I\\'ll elaborate on a few concepts and potential enhancements:\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Suggestions for Enhancement\\n1. **Error/Validation Handling**: Ensure input arrays `X` and `y` are of the same length. Add a check for this:\\n   ```python\\n   if len(X) != len(y):\\n       raise ValueError(\"The length of X and y must be the same.\")\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Handling Edge Cases**: For cases where the variance of `X` is zero (i.e., all values of `X` are the same), the denominator in the calculation of `m` would be zero. Handle this by returning an appropriate message or raising an exception:\\n   ```python\\n   if denominator == 0:\\n       raise ValueError(\"Variance of X is zero. Cannot compute a unique linear regression.\")\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Evaluate Model Performance**: Add optional metrics to evaluate the quality of the fit, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or Coefficient of Determination (\\\\(R^2\\\\)):\\n   ```python\\n   # Calculate Mean Squared Error\\n   mse = np.mean((y - y_pred)**2)\\n   \\n   # Calculate R-squared\\n   ss_total = np.sum((y - y_mean)**2)\\n   ss_residual = np.sum((y - y_pred)**2)\\n   r_squared = 1 - (ss_residual / ss_total)\\n   \\n   return {\\n       \"slope\": m,\\n       \"intercept\": b,\\n       \"predicted\": y_pred,\\n       \"mse\": mse,\\n       \"r_squared\": r_squared\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n4. **Plot Visualization**: Visualizing the data points and regression line is useful. Add a function to plot the results using `matplotlib`:\\n   ```python\\n   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n\\n   def plot_regression(X, y, y_pred):\\n       plt.scatter(X, y, color=\\'blue\\', label=\\'Data points\\')\\n       plt.plot(X, y_pred, color=\\'red\\', label=\\'Regression line\\')\\n       plt.xlabel(\\'X\\')\\n       plt.ylabel(\\'y\\')\\n       plt.legend()\\n       plt.title(\\'Linear Regression\\')\\n       plt.show()\\n   ```\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Updated Code with Enhancements\\nHere\\'s the enhanced version of the linear regression implementation:\\n\\n```python\\nimport numpy as np\\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\\n\\ndef linear_regression(X, y):\\n    \"\"\"\\n    Perform linear regression to fit a line y = mx + b to the data.\\n\\n    Parameters:\\n        X (array-like): 1D array of independent variable values (features).\\n        y (array-like): 1D array of dependent variable values (targets).\\n    \\n    Returns:\\n        dict: A dictionary containing slope (m), intercept (b), predicted values (y_pred), MSE, and R-squared.\\n    \"\"\"\\n    # Ensure X and y are numpy arrays\\n    X = np.array(X)\\n    y = np.array(y)\\n\\n    # Check for input errors\\n    if len(X) != len(y):\\n        raise ValueError(\"The length of X and y must be the same.\")\\n    \\n    # Calculate the means of X and y\\n    X_mean = np.mean(X)\\n    y_mean = np.mean(y)\\n    \\n    # Calculate the slope (m) and intercept (b)\\n    numerator = np.sum((X - X_mean) * (y - y_mean))\\n    denominator = np.sum((X - X_mean)**2)\\n    \\n    if denominator == 0:\\n        raise ValueError(\"Variance of X is zero.

The Transformer leverages self-attention to compute representations of its input and output sequences without relying on sequence-aligned recurrence or convolution, addressing the fundamental constraint of sequential computation that limits parallelization in traditional models. By using self-attention and Multi-Head Attention mechanisms, the Transformer efficiently models dependencies regardless of their distance in input or output sequences. It is highly parallelizable, faster to train, and achieves state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks, including 28.4 BLEU for English-to-German and 41.8 BLEU for English-to-French, outperforming previous models with reduced computational costs. Additionally, the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks such as English constituency parsing, demonstrating its versatility and efficiency.\n",

The decoder layers similarly include these sub-layers but add a third sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the encoder’s output. To ensure that predictions depend only on prior positions, the decoder’s self-attention mechanism incorporates masking.\n",

            "The attention mechanism introduced in the Transformer, termed *\"Scaled Dot-Product Attention,\"* involves dot products between queries and keys that are scaled by the square root of the key's dimensionality (√dk), followed by a softmax operation to compute attention weights. This scaling addresses issues with large dot product magnitudes that can push the softmax function into regions with extremely small gradients, improving performance for larger `dk` values. Additionally, Multi-Head Attention extends the attention mechanism by linearly projecting queries, keys, and values into smaller dimensions across multiple attention heads, enabling the model to capture information from different representation subspaces more effectively. With eight parallel attention heads, where each head operates on a reduced-dimensional subspace (`dk = dv = dmodel/h = 64`, with `dmodel = 512`), the computational cost remains similar to that of single-head attention while allowing the model to jointly attend to different subspaces at different positions. These projected outputs are concatenated and further processed to produce the final attention results, enhancing the model's ability to learn complex relationships within sequences.\n",

Furthermore, self-attention significantly shortens the path length between any two positions in the network, facilitating learning of long-range dependencies, a critical challenge in sequence transduction tasks.

This scaling addresses issues with large dot product magnitudes that can push the softmax function into regions with extremely small gradients, improving performance for larger `dk` values. Additionally, Multi-Head Attention extends the attention mechanism by linearly projecting queries, keys, and values into smaller dimensions across multiple attention heads, enabling the model to capture information from different representation subspaces more effectively. With eight parallel attention heads, where each head operates on a reduced-dimensional subspace (`dk = dv = dmodel/h = 64`, with `dmodel = 512`), the computational cost remains similar to that of single-head attention while allowing the model to jointly attend to different subspaces at different positions.

            "The paper *\"Attention Is All You Need\"* introduces the Transformer, a novel neural network architecture based entirely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrent or convolutional layers commonly used in sequence transduction tasks. The Transformer leverages self-attention to compute representations of its input and output sequences without relying on sequence-aligned recurrence or convolution, addressing the fundamental constraint of sequential computation that limits parallelization in traditional models. By using self-attention and Multi-Head Attention mechanisms, the Transformer efficiently models dependencies regardless of their distance in input or output sequences. It is highly parallelizable, faster to train, and achieves state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks, including 28.4 BLEU for English-to-German and 41.8 BLEU for English-to-French, outperforming previous models with reduced computational costs. Additionally, the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks such as English constituency parsing, demonstrating its versatility and efficiency.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The model architecture of the Transformer consists of an encoder-decoder structure, each comprising a stack of six identical layers. The encoder layers include two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network, both followed by residual connections and layer normalization. The decoder layers similarly include these sub-layers but add a third sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the encoder’s output. To ensure that predictions depend only on prior positions, the decoder’s self-attention mechanism incorporates masking.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The attention mechanism introduced in the Transformer, termed *\"Scaled Dot-Product Attention,\"* involves dot products between queries and keys that are scaled by the square root of the key's dimensionality (√dk), followed by a softmax operation to compute attention weights. This scaling addresses issues with large dot product magnitudes that can push the softmax function into regions with extremely small gradients, improving performance for larger `dk` values. Additionally, Multi-Head Attention extends the attention mechanism by linearly projecting queries, keys, and values into smaller dimensions across multiple attention heads, enabling the model to capture information from different representation subspaces more effectively. With eight parallel attention heads, where each head operates on a reduced-dimensional subspace (`dk = dv = dmodel/h = 64`, with `dmodel = 512`), the computational cost remains similar to that of single-head attention while allowing the model to jointly attend to different subspaces at different positions. These projected outputs are concatenated and further processed to produce the final attention results, enhancing the model's ability to learn complex relationships within sequences.  \n",
            "\n",
            "The Transformer employs multi-head attention in three distinct ways: encoder-decoder attention, where queries from the decoder attend to the encoder outputs; encoder self-attention, where each position attends to all others within the encoder's previous layer; and decoder self-attention, where each position attends to prior positions in the decoder to preserve the autoregressive property, achieved through masking.  \n",
            "\n",
            "In addition to attention sub-layers, each layer in the encoder and decoder contains a position-wise feed-forward network (FFN) that is applied identically and independently at each position. The FFN consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between, effectively acting as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The inner layer has a dimensionality of 2048, while the input/output dimensionality is 512.  \n",
            "\n",
            "To represent tokens, learned embeddings map input and output tokens to vectors of dimension 512 (`dmodel`). These embeddings share weights with the pre-softmax linear transformation, scaled by √`dmodel`. Additionally, since the Transformer lacks recurrence or convolution, positional encodings are added to the embeddings to inject information about the order of the sequence, enabling the model to account for positional relationships effectively. The positional encodings are parameterized using sinusoidal functions of different frequencies:  \n",
            "\\[ PE(pos, 2i) = \\sin(pos/10000^{(2i/d_{model})}) \\quad PE(pos, 2i+1) = \\cos(pos/10000^{(2i/d_{model})}) \\]  \n",

            "\n",
            "The Transformer’s reliance on self-attention confers notable advantages over traditional recurrent and convolutional layers. Self-attention layers achieve lower computational complexity (\\(O(n^2·d)\\)) and enable maximum parallelization with \\(O(1)\\) sequential operations, as noted in Table 1, compared to recurrent layers that require \\(O(n)\\) sequential operations or convolutional layers which scale with \\(O(\\log_k(n))\\) maximum path lengths. Furthermore, self-attention significantly shortens the path length between any two positions in the network, facilitating learning of long-range dependencies, a critical challenge in sequence transduction tasks. This improvement is particularly evident when sequence length (`n`) is smaller than representation dimensionality (`d`), a common scenario in state-of-the-art models such as word-piece and byte-pair encoding for tasks like machine translation. Additionally, self-attention may provide more interpretable models by revealing syntactic and semantic relationships learned by individual attention heads.  \n",

Sentences were encoded with byte-pair encoding or word-piece vocabularies, containing approximately 37,000 and 32,000 tokens, respectively. Models were trained using batches of approximately 25,000 source and target tokens per batch. Training relied on 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs, with base models trained for 12 hours (100,000 steps) and larger models trained for 3.5 days (300,000 steps). Optimization employed the Adam optimizer, using a dynamic learning rate with linear warmup over the first 4,000 steps followed by decay. Dropout was applied as a regularization technique at embedding, sub-layer, and positional encoding levels, with rates set to 0.1 for the base model and 0.3 for larger models. Label smoothing (ϵls = 0.1) was utilized during training, which slightly worsened perplexity but improved BLEU scores.  \n",

For instance, the \"Transformer (big)\" achieves 28.4 BLEU for English-to-German and 41.8 BLEU for English-to-French, outperforming previous ensembles while reducing training cost by more than 75%. The model’s efficiency stems from its self-attention mechanisms, highly parallelizable design, and reduced reliance on computationally intensive layers. Model experiments also identified that larger attention key sizes (`dk`) improved performance, suggesting potential benefits of more sophisticated compatibility functions beyond scaled dot-product attention. Dropout was shown to mitigate overfitting and boost performance, while replacing sinusoidal positional encodings with learned positional embeddings demonstrated similar results.  \n",

Efforts to apply the Transformer to other modalities such as images, audio, and video are underway, with a focus on adapting attention mechanisms to efficiently process large inputs and outputs.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsigniﬁcant improvements in computational efﬁciency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12].

That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016) kpathsea version 6.2.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'attention_is_all_you_need.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 3, 'page_label': '4'}, page_content='Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\n Multi-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices Kand V. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q,K,V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof 1√dk\\n. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efﬁcient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by 1√dk\\n.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneﬁcial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the ﬁnal values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = ∑dk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016) kpathsea version 6.2.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'attention_is_all_you_need.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 4, 'page_label': '5'}, page_content='Multi-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions.

For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h= 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation ﬂow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0,xW1 + b1)W2 + b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\n5'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016) kpathsea version 6.2.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'attention_is_all_you_need.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 5, 'page_label': '6'}, page_content='Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention O(n2 ·d) O(1) O(1)\\nRecurrent O(n·d2) O(n) O(n)\\nConvolutional O(k·n·d2) O(1) O(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r·n·d) O(1) O(n/r)\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and ﬁxed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel )\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto 10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any ﬁxed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1,...,x n) to another sequence of equal length (z1,...,z n), with xi,zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\n6'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016) kpathsea version 6.2.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'attention_is_all_you_need.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 6, 'page_label': '7'}, page_content='the input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k<n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+ n·d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side beneﬁt, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the signiﬁcantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate= d−0.5\\nmodel ·min(step_num−0.5,step_num·warmup_steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the ﬁrst warmup_stepstraining steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps= 4000.\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\n7'), Document(metadata={'producer': 'pdfTeX-1.40.17', 'creator': 'LaTeX with hyperref package', 'creationdate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'author': '', 'keywords': '', 'moddate': '2017-12-07T01:03:15+00:00', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.17 (TeX Live 2016) kpathsea version 6.2.2', 'subject': '', 'title': '', 'trapped': '/False', 'source': 'attention_is_all_you_need.pdf', 'total_pages': 15, 'page': 7, 'page_label': '8'}, page_content='Table 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE EN-FR EN-DE EN-FR\\nByteNet [18] 23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39] 39.2 1.0 ·1020\\nGNMT + RL [38] 24.6 39.92 2.3 ·1019 1.4 ·1020\\nConvS2S [9] 25.16 40.46 9.6 ·1018 1.5 ·1020\\nMoE [32] 26.03 40.56 2.0 ·1019 1.2 ·1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] 40.4 8.0 ·1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38] 26.30 41.16 1.8 ·1020 1.1 ·1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9] 26.36 41.29 7.7 ·1019 1.2 ·1021\\nTransformer (base model) 27.3 38.1 3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big) 28.4 41.8 2.3 ·1019\\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36].

The example of attention heads involved in anaphora resolution in layer 5 is consistent with the already-discussed ability of the Transformer to learn complex relationships and dependencies, including long-range interactions. Therefore, the original summary remains comprehensive and accurate.\\n\\n### Final Summary:\\n\\nThe paper *\"Attention Is All You Need\"* introduces the Transformer, a novel neural network architecture based entirely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrent or convolutional layers commonly used in sequence transduction tasks. The Transformer leverages self-attention to compute representations of its input and output sequences without relying on sequence-aligned recurrence or convolution, addressing the fundamental constraint of sequential computation that limits parallelization in traditional models. By using self-attention and Multi-Head Attention mechanisms, the Transformer efficiently models dependencies regardless of their distance in input or output sequences. It is highly parallelizable, faster to train, and achieves state-of-the-art results in machine translation tasks, including 28.4 BLEU for English-to-German and 41.8 BLEU for English-to-French, outperforming previous models with reduced computational costs. Additionally, the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks such as English constituency parsing, demonstrating its versatility and efficiency.\\n\\nThe model architecture of the Transformer consists of an encoder-decoder structure, each comprising a stack of six identical layers. The encoder layers include two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a position-wise fully connected feed-forward network, both followed by residual connections and layer normalization. The decoder layers similarly include these sub-layers but add a third sub-layer that performs multi-head attention over the encoder’s output. To ensure that predictions depend only on prior positions, the decoder’s self-attention mechanism incorporates masking.\\n\\nThe attention mechanism introduced in the Transformer, termed *\"Scaled Dot-Product Attention,\"* involves dot products between queries and keys that are scaled by the square root of the key\\'s dimensionality (√dk), followed by a softmax operation to compute attention weights. This scaling addresses issues with large dot product magnitudes that can push the softmax function into regions with extremely small gradients, improving performance for larger `dk` values. Additionally, Multi-Head Attention extends the attention mechanism by linearly projecting queries, keys, and values into smaller dimensions across multiple attention heads, enabling the model to capture information from different representation subspaces more effectively. With eight parallel attention heads, where each head operates on a reduced-dimensional subspace (`dk = dv = dmodel/h = 64`, with `dmodel = 512`), the computational cost remains similar to that of single-head attention while allowing the model to jointly attend to different subspaces at different positions. These projected outputs are concatenated and further processed to produce the final attention results, enhancing the model\\'s ability to learn complex relationships within sequences.\\n\\nThe Transformer employs multi-head attention in three distinct ways: encoder-decoder attention, where queries from the decoder attend to the encoder outputs; encoder self-attention, where each position attends to all others within the encoder\\'s previous layer; and decoder self-attention, where each position attends to prior positions in the decoder to preserve the autoregressive property, achieved through masking.\\n\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each layer in the encoder and decoder contains a position-wise feed-forward network (FFN) that is applied identically and independently at each position. The FFN consists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between, effectively acting as two convolutions with kernel size 1. The inner layer has a dimensionality of 2048, while the input/output dimensionality is 512.\\n\\nTo represent tokens, learned embeddings map input and output tokens to vectors of dimension 512 (`dmodel`). These embeddings share weights with the pre-softmax linear transformation, scaled by √`dmodel`. Additionally, since the Transformer lacks recurrence or convolution, positional encodings are added to the embeddings to inject information about the order of the sequence, enabling the model to account for positional relationships effectively. The positional encodings are parameterized using sinusoidal functions of different frequencies:  \\n\\\\[ PE(pos, 2i) = \\\\sin(pos/10000^{(2i/d_{model})}) \\\\quad PE(pos, 2i+1) = \\\\cos(pos/10000^{(2i/d_{model})}) \\\\]  \\nwhere `pos` is the position and `i` is the dimension. The sinusoidal encoding was chosen over learned positional embeddings for its ability to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than those seen during training, though experiments report that learning positional embeddings performs comparably in terms of translation accuracy (BLEU scores).\\n\\nThe Transformer’s reliance on self-attention confers notable advantages over traditional recurrent and convolutional layers. Self-attention layers achieve lower computational complexity (\\\\(O(n^2·d)\\\\)) and enable maximum parallelization with \\\\(O(1)\\\\) sequential operations, as noted in Table 1, compared to recurrent layers that require \\\\(O(n)\\\\) sequential operations or convolutional layers which scale with \\\\(O(\\\\log_k(n))\\\\) maximum path lengths. Furthermore, self-attention significantly shortens the path length between any two positions in the network, facilitating learning of long-range dependencies, a critical challenge in sequence transduction tasks. This improvement is particularly evident when sequence length (`n`) is smaller than representation dimensionality (`d`), a common scenario in state-of-the-art models such as word-piece and byte-pair encoding for tasks like machine translation. Additionally, self-attention may provide more interpretable models by revealing syntactic and semantic relationships learned by individual attention heads.\\n\\nFor training, the authors report using the WMT 2014 English-German dataset with 4.5M sentence pairs and the WMT 2014 English-French dataset with 36M sentences. Sentences were encoded with byte-pair encoding or word-piece vocabularies, containing approximately 37,000 and 32,000 tokens, respectively. Models were trained using batches of approximately 25,000 source and target tokens per batch. Training relied on 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs, with base models trained for 12 hours (100,000 steps) and larger models trained for 3.5 days (300,000 steps). Optimization employed the Adam optimizer, using a dynamic learning rate with linear warmup over the first 4,000 steps followed by decay. Dropout was applied as a regularization technique at embedding, sub-layer, and positional encoding levels, with rates set to 0.1 for the base model and 0.3 for larger models. Label smoothing (ϵls = 0.1) was utilized during training, which slightly worsened perplexity but improved BLEU scores.\\n\\nExploring variations in the Transformer architecture revealed that increasing model size improves performance, although at the cost of greater computational resources. For instance, the \"Transformer (big)\" achieves 28.4 BLEU for English-to-German and 41.8 BLEU for English-to-French, outperforming previous ensembles while reducing training cost by more than 75%. The model’s efficiency stems from its self-attention mechanisms, highly parallelizable design, and reduced reliance on computationally intensive layers. Model experiments also identified that larger attention key sizes (`dk`) improved performance, suggesting potential benefits of more sophisticated compatibility functions beyond scaled dot-product attention. Dropout was shown to mitigate overfitting and boost performance, while replacing sinusoidal positional encodings with learned positional embeddings demonstrated similar results.\\n\\nIn addition to translation, the Transformer generalizes effectively to other tasks, such as English constituency parsing, where it achieves competitive F1 scores of 91.3 in a WSJ-only setting (trained on 40k sentences) and 92.7 in a semi-supervised setting using additional high-confidence dataset corpora with approximately 17M sentences. Efforts to apply the Transformer to other modalities such as images, audio, and video are underway, with a focus on adapting attention mechanisms to efficiently process large inputs and outputs. The Transformer demonstrates its potential as a versatile and computationally efficient tool for sequence modeling, achieving state-of-the-art results across multiple NLP tasks while setting the foundation for future advancements in attention-based models.\\n\\nThus, the Transformer represents a paradigm shift in sequence modeling, leveraging self-attention to enhance parallelism, efficiency, interpretability, and performance across a range of NLP tasks. Its ability to achieve state-of-the-art results while reducing computational costs highlights its transformative impact on the field of deep learning.'}\n"
