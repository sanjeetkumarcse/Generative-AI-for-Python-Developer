## Project 1: Enterprise Knowledge & Workflow Assistant

### 1. Problem Statement

Enterprises face challenges managing vast internal documentation and repetitive workflows. Employees spend significant time searching for policies, generating reports, and writing formal communications. An intelligent assistant is needed to automate document understanding, knowledge retrieval, and workflow tasks seamlessly.

### 2. Objective

Develop a unified AI assistant that:

* Reads, summarizes, and answers questions from enterprise documents.
* Automates HR, finance, and communication workflows.
* Generates multi-modal reports combining text, charts, and visuals.
* Provides a real-time conversational interface for users.

### 3. Tech Stack

* **LangChain, LangGraph** – Orchestration and RAG pipeline
* **ChromaDB** – Semantic retrieval and embeddings
* **Azure OpenAI GPT-4o**  – LLM reasoning engine
* **FastAPI** – Backend API layer
* **Streamlit** – Chat-based UI
* **Docker** – Deployment and containerization


### 4. Key Features
* Context-aware Q&A over enterprise documents.
* Automated report and email generation.
* Real-time chat interface with workflow automation.
* Visual summaries (charts, graphs, infographics).
* Performance monitoring and structured logging.

## Project 2: Intelligent Document & Task Automation Hub

### 1. Problem Statement

Enterprises deal with repetitive administrative processes such as form-filling, compliance reporting, and data entry from PDF or Excel documents. These manual operations are time-consuming, error-prone, and lack integration between data sources. A need exists for an intelligent AI system that automates these multi-step workflows.

### 2. Objective

Design an AI-driven document understanding and task automation system that:

* Extracts and answers queries from complex documents.
* Automates form-filling, email drafting, and reporting.
* Generates multi-modal dashboards with textual and visual summaries.
* Provides scalable REST APIs for enterprise integration.


### 3. Tech Stack

* **AutoGen** – Workflow orchestration and automation
* **Pinecone / ChromaDB** – Semantic search and retrieval
* **GPT-4o / Mistral Large** – LLM reasoning
* **FastAPI + Flask** – Backend and user interface
* **Docker** – Deployment infrastructure


### 4. Key Features

* RAG-based intelligent document understanding.
* Automated multi-step workflows (fill, summarize, email, report).
* Visual output generation (charts and images).
* Secure, role-based chatbot interface.
* Real-time monitoring and performance analytics.
