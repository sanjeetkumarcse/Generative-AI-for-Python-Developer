The old company's enterprise product and business services divisions were spun-off into a new publicly traded company, Hewlett Packard Enterprise. At the same time as the divesture, Hewlett-Packard Company renamed itself to HP Inc. and retained the personal computer and printer services divisions of its predecessor, serving as the legal successor of the original company that was founded in 1939.

Founded in 1976 as Apple Computer Company by Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak and Ronald Wayne, the company was incorporated by Jobs and Wozniak as Apple Computer, Inc. the following year. It was renamed to its current name in 2007 as the company had expanded its focus from computers to consumer electronics. Apple is considered part of the Big Tech group, alongside Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta. \\nThe company was founded to market Wozniak\\'s Apple I personal computer. Its successor, the Apple II, became one of the first successful mass-produced microcomputers. Apple introduced the Lisa in 1983 and the Macintosh in 1984 as some of the first computers to use a graphical user interface and a mouse. By 1985, internal conflicts led to Jobs leaving the company to form NeXT and Wozniak withdrawing to other ventures; John Sculley served as CEO for over a decade. In the 1990s, Apple lost considerable market share in the personal computer industry to the lower-priced Wintel duopoly of Intel-powered PC clones running Microsoft Windows, and neared bankruptcy by 1997. To overhaul its market strategy, it acquired NeXT, bringing Jobs back to the company. Under his leadership, Apple returned to profitability by introducing the iMac, iPod, iPhone, and iPad devices; creating the iTunes Store; launching the \"Think different\" advertising campaign; and opening the Apple Store retail chain. Jobs resigned in 2011 for health reasons, and died two months later; he was succeeded as CEO by Tim Cook.\\nApple\\'s product lineup includes portable and home hardware like the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac, and Apple TV; several in-house operating systems such as iOS, iPadOS, and macOS; and various software and services including Apple Pay and iCloud, as well as multimedia streaming services like Apple Music and Apple TV. Since 2011, Apple has for the most part been the world\\'s largest company by market capitalization, and, as of 2024, is the largest manufacturing company by revenue, the fourth-largest personal computer vendor, the largest vendor of tablet computers, and the largest vendor of mobile phones. Apple became the first publicly traded US company to be valued at over $1 trillion in 2018, and, as of October 2025, is valued at just over $4 trillion.\\nApple has received criticism regarding its contractors\\' labor conditions, its relationship with trade unions, its environmental practices, and its corporate ethics, including anti-competitive tactics, materials sourcing, and its acquisitions of smaller businesses. Nevertheless, the company has a large following and enjoys a high level of customer loyalty.

These modules include Local Traffic Manager (LTM), Advanced Web Application Firewall (AWAF), DNS (previously named GTM), and Access Policy Manager (APM). These offer organizations that run BIG-IP systems the ability to deploy load balancing, Layer 7 application firewalls, single sign-on (for Azure AD, Active Directory, LDAP, and Okta), as well as enterprise-level VPNs.

It also has major development operations in Noida and Bangalore in India. The company has long been the dominant tech firm in design and creative software, despite attracting criticism for its policies and practices particularly around Adobe Creative Cloud's switch to subscription only pricing and its early termination fees for its most promoted Creative Cloud plan, the latter of which attracted a joint civil lawsuit from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the U.S. Department of Justice in 2024.\\n\\n\"]],\n"," 'uris': None,\n"," 'included': ['metadatas', 'documents', 'distances'],\n"," 'data': None,\n"," 'metadatas': [[{'GICS Sector': 'Information Technology',\n","    'Security': 'HP Inc.',\n","    'date_added': '1974-12-31',\n","    'GICS Sub-Industry': 'Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals',\n","    'date_founded': 1939},\n","   {'date_added': '1982-11-30',\n","    'GICS Sector': 'Information Technology',\n","    'date_founded': 1977,\n","    'Security': 'Apple Inc.',\n","    'GICS Sub-Industry': 'Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals'},\n","   {'GICS Sector': 'Information Technology',\n","    'Security': 'PTC Inc.',\n","    'date_founded': 1985,\n","    'GICS Sub-Industry': 'Application Software',\n","    'date_added': '2021-04-20'},\n","   {'date_added': '2010-12-20',\n","    'GICS Sector': 'Information Technology',\n","    'GICS Sub-Industry': 'Communications Equipment',\n","    'Security': 'F5, Inc.',\n","    'date_founded': 1996},\n","   {'GICS Sector': 'Information Technology',\n","    'Security': 'Adobe Inc.',\n","    'GICS Sub-Industry': 'Application Software',\n","    'date_founded': 1982,\n","    'date_added': '1997-05-05'}]],\n"," 'distances': [[1.3806825876235962,\n","   1.4241777658462524,\n","   1.4705760478973389,\n","   1.5314728021621704,\n","   1.6237698793411255]]}"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":22}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# more filters\n","\n","$eq: equal to.\n","\n","$ne: not equal to.\n","\n","$gt: greater than.\n","\n","$gte: greater than or equal to.\n","\n","$lt: less than.\n","\n","$lte: less than or equal to."],"metadata":{"id":"-H3UaDDSvc5i"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["Let’s apply the same query to companies in the Information Technology sector but, in addition, their creation date is greater than 1990."],"metadata":{"id":"LnLARiSJvtYu"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["where_clause = {\n","    \"$and\" : [\n","        {\"GICS Sector\" : {\"$eq\": \"Information Technology\"}},\n","        {\"date_founded\": {\"$gte\": 1990}}\n","    ]\n","}\n","\n","results = collection.query(\n","    query_texts=\"phone manufacturers\",\n","    n_results=5,\n","    where = where_clause\n",")\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"VX7CB32VuKkc","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761722652017,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":201,"user":{"displayName":"Sanjeet Kumar","userId":"04421430539115510426"}}},"execution_count":23,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["results"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"lve9qoNmv45Z","outputId":"de8bcb67-322e-4fd3-de0f-b4c02b283774","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1761722669862,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":16,"user":{"displayName":"Sanjeet Kumar","userId":"04421430539115510426"}}},"execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["{'ids': [['18', '46']],\n"," 'embeddings': None,\n"," 'documents': [[\"F5, Inc. is an American technology company specializing in application security, multi-cloud management, online fraud prevention, application delivery networking (ADN), application availability and performance, and network security, access, and authorization.\\nF5 originally offered application delivery controller (ADC) technology, but has since expanded into application layer, automation, multi-cloud, and security services. As ransomware, data leaks, DDoS, and other attacks on businesses of all sizes are arising, companies such as F5 have continued to reinvent themselves.\\nF5 is headquartered in Seattle, Washington in F5 Tower, with an additional 75 offices in 43 countries focusing on account management, global services support, product development, manufacturing, software engineering, and administrative jobs. Notable office locations include Spokane, Washington; New York, New York; Boulder, Colorado; London, England; San Jose, California; and San Francisco, California.\\nWhile the majority of F5's revenue continues to be attributed to its hardware products, such as the BIG-IP iSeries systems, the company has begun to offer additional modules on its proprietary operating system, TMOS (Traffic Management Operating System). These modules include Local Traffic Manager (LTM), Advanced Web Application Firewall (AWAF), DNS (previously named GTM), and Access Policy Manager (APM). These offer organizations that run BIG-IP systems the ability to deploy load balancing, Layer 7 application firewalls, single sign-on (for Azure AD, Active Directory, LDAP, and Okta), as well as enterprise-level VPNs. While the BIG-IP was traditionally a hardware product, F5 now offers it as a virtual machine, which it has branded as the BIG-IP Virtual Edition. The BIG-IP Virtual Edition is cloud-agnostic and can be deployed on-premises in a public and/or hybrid cloud environment.\\n\\n\",\n","   \"Workday, Inc., is an American on‑demand (cloud-based) financial management, human capital management, and student information system software vendor.
